   # extract_cookies.sh:
   #
   # Convert from Firefox's cookies.sqlite format to Netscape cookies,
   # which can then be used by wget and curl. (Why don't wget and curl
   # just use libsqlite if it's installed?)
   
   # USAGE:
   #
   # $ extract_cookies.sh > /tmp/cookies.txt
   # or
   # $ extract_cookies.sh ~/.mozilla/firefox/*default*/cookies.sqlite > /tmp/cookies.txt
   
   # USING WITH WGET:
   # $ wget --load-cookies=/tmp/cookies.txt http://mysite.com
   
   # USING WITH CURL:
   # $ curl --cookie /tmp/cookies.txt http://mysite.com
   
   # Note: If you do not specify an SQLite filename, this script will
   # intelligently find it for you.
   #
   # A) Usually it will check all profiles under ~/.mozilla/firefox/ and
   # use the cookies.sqlite that was updated most recently.
   #
   # B) If you've redirected stdin (with < or |) , then that will be used.
   
   
   # HISTORY: I believe this is circa 2010 from:
   # http://slacy.com/blog/2010/02/using-cookies-sqlite-in-wget-or-curl/
   # However, that site is down now.
   
   # Cleaned up by Hackerb9 (2017) to be more robust and require less typing.
